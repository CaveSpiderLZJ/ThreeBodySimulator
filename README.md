# Three-Body Problem Simulator

Hi there! This is a super simple three-body problem simulator in Python.

To run the code, just set some initial parameters of the stars and the planet in `main.py`, then run `python main.py` and you are done!

You can then find the output track video `out.mp4` in the root dir.

I have tried hundreds of initial conditions to get a beautiful result (the default parameters).

Feel free to do the experiments yourself to get a better result. Have fun :)
